What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I looked at the oneCard example code and ended up spending a lot of time reading documentation just to try to familiarize myself again with git and to apply what we have been learning. It really helped to try to map things out on a blank piece of paper to help visualie the functionality of each object and to try to see how each object will interact. My advice: READ DOCUMENTATION. ITS TIME CONSUMING AND YOU'LL SPEND SO MUCH TIME LOOKING FOR VERY SPECIFIC ASPECTS AND FUNCTIONS BUT ITS SO WORTH IT.
